\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

Weather station density varies greatly across the globe, depending on population density,
economic development, and the availability of infrastructure. \cite{ortizbobea2021}
Not only would a denser network benefit weather forecasting, but it would also be beneficial
for climate research. For example in East Africa, the weather station density is very low,
but the region would be of great interest to the El Ni√±o Southern Oscillation (ENSO)
research. \cite{marchant2007, muita2021}
An innovative approach to increase the density of weather stations could be to use
low-cost weather stations that could be 3D-printed and assembled by the local population.
\cite{muita2021}, either way, low-cost weather stations have reliability issues. That could
be because of the lack of backup sensors, theft, or bushfires.
