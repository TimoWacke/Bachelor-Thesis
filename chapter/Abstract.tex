This bachelor thesis presents a method to reconstruct missing temperature measurements from low-cost weather stations using ERA5 Reanalysis data and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
The work aims to address challenges posed by sparse weather station coverage by supporting low-cost stations with gap-filling.
The proposed method involves training a CNN model to estimate the weather stations hourly measurements based on the surrounding 8x8 grid data from the ERA5 Reanalysis.
The trained model can then reconstruct missing station data, outperforming traditional numerical methods in computational efficiency.
The thesis describes the conceptual framework, including data acquisition, preprocessing, CNN training, model validation using metrics like RMSE and correlation coefficient, and application for filling missing data.
It provides background on CNNs and atmospheric reanalysis.
The results evaluate the models' performance across stations in different environments.
The implementation covers the pipeline for training models, reconstructing data, data handling, interfacing with the Copernicus API, and preprocessing steps.
It also discusses process orchestration with a web interface and API for training, infilling, and validation.
